### Description

Have you ever wanted to have a place to put your code that you downloaded from PSC? Is tracking it all down and remembering what it is a problem?

Well, fret no more. With PSCdl2, you can keep track of all those nasty little bits of code in one spot. Building upon Thomas Hannibal's original code, I thought this is cool, but keeping track of all this is tough. I "lightened" it up a bit by removing some objects that cost heavy on the development side and redistribution.

Features include:

Drag-drop of all data including images and links to ZIP files.

Ability to retrieve ZIPs/Images/Abouts

Great for sites other than just PSC!

Features to come:

Edit entry titles

Edit descriptions

Delete entries

Upload from other sources!

Included:

Version 1 to version 2 utility (Read comments in Form1.frm under Quick Load)

Some sample code already uploaded.

This is a work in progress so PLEASE VOTE!!!

(Sorry commenting is so sparse... I'll fix that in a later release)
